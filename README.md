## Welcome to Blender Best Tutorials

When I started learning Blender, I have jumped from tutorial to tutorial, and gleam what I could from each. Which tutorial is overwhelming for beginners, which tutorial contains useless things, which tutorial is can be finished in a day, and will show you how to make your first scene.

And so I have created a site where I stored all best tutorials that I have ever seen.
